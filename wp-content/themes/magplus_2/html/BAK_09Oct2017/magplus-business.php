  </h1>
  <p>
  Mag+ is the ideal solution for content-based apps for your company.
  We are the app solution for Fortune 500 companies from sectors including banking, big data and telecommunications.

  Here are just a few uses for Mag+ apps for your business:</p>
  <br>
  <div class="mbox3">
    <p>
    <strong>Build Smart and Engaging <br>Sales Collateral</strong>
    <br>
     Incorporate video, animations, web forms (including email capture and quote forms).
     Get real-time analytics on how the presentations are used. Update content anytime, organize multiple presentations in one app.
     Communication directly with your sales reps via push notification or segmented in-app messaging. 
    </p>

  <div class="mbox3">
    <p>
      <strong>Publish an HR App</strong><br>
      Increase employee awareness by delivering critical material directly to their tablets and smartphones, so they don't have to seek it out on the intranet.
      Segment content by audience, so hourly employees only see the material they need, while salaried employees see only what's relevant to them.
      Easily build feedback tools into the app to facilitate two-way communication.
    </p>
  </div>
<div class="mbox3" style="margin-right: -1px;">
    <p>
      <strong>Create Internal and
      <br>External Presentations</strong>
      <br>
      Blow away those boring Powerpoints.
      Distribute directly to your audiences' tablets and smartphones as a leave behind,
      in a format they can consume but not edit.
      Create engaging graphics, live content and video; build in simple ways for your audience to respond and interact.

    <h2>A regular Mag+ app vs a SDK custom app?</h2>
    <p>
      Here are just a few of the things you 
      can do with a custom app you can’t do 
      with a regular Mag+ app.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Change the menu.</strong> With the Mag+ SDK, you 
      build your own menu, so you can add new options, like a shopping cart or custom buttons. 
      And the menu can be anywhere you want and 
      look however you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Customize the store and library.</strong> Want a different storefront? With the SDK, you can build 
      your own store and library interfaces and decide 
      what goes in them. You can even skip both all 
      together and just bundle your issue into the 
      app.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Add third-party services.</strong> Want Google analytics in your app? Or Facebook’s OpenGraph 
      API? With the SDK, you can build whatever 
      third-party services you want into your app.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="mhalf">
    <img src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/html/images/SDK_Regular_vs_SDK_2jn.jpg" alt="Regular vs SDK" class="imgwide">
    <p>
      <strong>Change the navigation.</strong> The SDK includes 
      some of the basic Mag+ features, like the 
      thumbnail scrubber and the page-length indicator, but you can delete these, change them, 
      or build your own. You can even create your 
      own control gestures.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Embed the Mag+ reader in another app.</strong> Already have an app—maybe a game, tool or 
      catalog? With the SDK, you can put the Mag+ 
      reader inside that app, so reading your content 
      becomes just another feature of your app.

     <p>
      <strong>Issue publishing:</strong> 
      When you’re done with an issue, 
      upload it to Publish and decide which devices you 
      want to publish it to. Add a cover, title and description 
      for the store and library. Hit the Publish button and 
      your issue shows up in your app. Tie it to an in-app 
      purchase to sell it, or make it free, you decide. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Push notifications:</strong> Send unlimited notifications to 
      your users just by typing in a message and hitting 
      send.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Full subscription Control:</strong> 
      Use our simple subscription API to tie your app into your existing fulfillment 
      house and sell subscriptions on your own site, or control access with a sign in window.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Newsstand:</strong> 
      Build an app that’s compatible with 
      Apple’s Newsstand and even get an automated feed 
      for sending the right cover art to the Newsstand when 
      you publish.

    <p>
      <strong>No Download Charges:</strong> 
      With Mag+, you always have 
      the opportunity to host issues yourself and pay nothing to us. 
      Or you can use our hosting and pay a few 
      cents per issue—no pre-payment necessary.

      The following components are included in the SDK package.
    </p>
    <div class="mbox3-inside">
      <h3>The Reader</h3>
      <p>(MIBKit)</p>
      <p>
        The Mag+ iOS SDK consists of over 
        40 Objective-C classes and protocols 
        for parsing, rendering and interacting 
        with MIB files created using the Mag+ 
        tools. 
      </p>
      <p>
        MIBKit is designed as a first class UIKit citizen, adhering to Cocoa Touch 
        convention and best practises. 
      </p>
      <p>
        MIBKit is ready for both low level 
        customisation and high level convenience, leveraging Core Animation for 
        high performance, and the latest iOS 
        features for sharing content and media playback.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of MIBKit as your WebKit for 
        high production value Mag+ content.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="mbox3-inside">
      <h3>Connector</h3>
      <p>(DennisKit)</p>
      <p>
        The Mag+ iOS SDK includes nonblocking asynchronous APIs for accessing the Mag+ publishing platform. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Including accessing issues, entitlements, subscriptions and application 
        run-time configuration settings. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As well as robust content download, 
        including background Newsstand 
        downloads, and integration with 
        StoreKit and third party subscription 
        services.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="mbox3-inside">
      <h3>Docs &amp; Samples</h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Included in the Mag+ iOS SDK is fully 
        integrated documentation as Xcode 
        docsets, for inline and searchable help. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Small, and to the point, example projects are included to get you started 
        and demonstrate Mag+ iOS SDK key features. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mag+ SDK requires Xcode 4.5 or 
        later, take advantage of the latest iOS 
        6 features, while being able to target 
        back to iOS 5.0.

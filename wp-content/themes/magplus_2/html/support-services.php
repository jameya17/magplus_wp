<h2>Professional Services</h2>

<ul class="one-time">
<li>
   <h3>Managed App Submission (MAS)<strong>$1,499<em>for initial Marketplace</em> </strong></h3>
   <p>
    You finish your first Issue and help page. You open a developer account with the Marketplace(s) of your choice. We will send you a list of needed assets (icons, loading screens, etc) and we will build your App in mag+ Publish, send you a test App to review and, when you sign off, we will submit your App to the Marketplace of your choice for you. We can build and submit your App to additional Marketplaces for $999 each.
  </p>

  <em class="disl">
  Apps must still go through standard Marketplace approval process but we will correct any mag+ Software bugs to promote App approval. We cannot be responsible for any content-related rejections.
  </em>
</li>
<li>
 <h3>Guided Managed App Submission <strong>$1,999<em>per Marketplace</em> </strong></h3>

  <p>
  For an additional $500 per Marketplace, we will schedule a 1-hour* private screenshare with your team and walk you through the App build and submission process. This is a great option for those that plan to create multiple Apps and want to see the process completed once from beginning to end so you can later replicate the steps on your own.  
  </p>
  <em class="disl">
    *To be scheduled during normal business hours.
  </em>

</li>
<li>
   <h3>Managed App Update (MAU) <strong>$999<em>per Marketplace, per Update</em> </strong></h3>
   <p>
    Want to update your existing App to the latest mag+ Software version, add Newsstand functionality, or swap out your navigation graphics? For $999 per Marketplace, let us know what updates you would like made to your App shell and we will make the changes, generate a new build, get your approval, and submit the new version on your behalf. We will submit your app update to additional Marketplaces for $749 per Marketplace.
  </p>

  <em class="disl">
    To clarify, the App shell refers to the content container that is created on your Publish site and submitted to the desired Marketplace. This service does not include content creation or updating.
  </em>

</li>
<li>
 <h3>Managed Issue Update<strong>$499<em>per Issue (includes any/all Marketplaces)</em> </strong></h3>

  <p>
  For $499 per Issue, we will get your in-App purchase tokens pre-approved in the Marketplaces of your choosing, create your new Issue on your mag+ Publish site, upload your completed MIB files (if you choose to Host with us), and push your Issue live after you give the thumbs up.
  </p>
  <em class="disl">
    This service does not include any content creation or editing.

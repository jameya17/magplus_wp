    <h3>Managed App Submission <strong><?php echo price('MAS'); ?></strong></h3>
    You finish your first issue and help page. You open a developer account with Apple, Google Play or Amazon.<br>
    We will send you a list of needed assets (icons, loading 
    screens, etc) and we will build your app in mag+ Publish, 
    send you a test app to review and, when you sign off, we<br>
    will submit your app to the platform of your choice for you. 
    Apps must still go through standard Apple or Amazon 
    approval process but we will correct any mag+ bugs to ensure the app is approved. We cannot be responsible for any 
    content-related rejections.

    <h3>Guided Managed App Submission <strong style="margin-right: -160px; display: inline-block;"><span style="position: relative; top: -0.05em;">+</span><span style="font-size: 0.4em;"> </span>$499</strong></h3>
    <div class="mhalf">
      For an additional $499 per marketplace, we will schedule a private screenshare with your team and walk you through the app build and submission process. This is a great option
     for those that plan to create multiple apps and want to see the process completed once from beginning to end so you can later replicate the steps on your own.

   <h3>Managed App Update <strong>$999</strong></h3>
    Want to update your existing app to the latest mag+ version, add Newsstand functionality,
    or swap out your navigation graphics?  For $999 per marketplace, let us know what updates
     you would like to be made to your app shell and we will make the changes, generate a new build,
      get your approval, and submit new version on your behalf.

  <div class="mhalf">
       <h3>Managed Issue Update <strong>$499</strong></h3>
       For $499 per issue, we will get your in-app purchase tokens pre-approved in the marketplaces
        of your choosing, create your new issue on your mag+ Publish site, upload your completed MIB files
         (if you choose to host with us), and push your issue live after you give the thumbs up.

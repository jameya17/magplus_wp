					<p>Adobe has made it clear they are only interested in offering digital publishing software to the big dogs. mag+ loves all dogs (little ones, medium ones, and the big ones!) So if you’re looking for the best alternative to Adobe DPS, the mag+ Designd tool is just what you need.</p>
					<p><b>Here are 10 reasons why </b><strong>(Find out why Steve Jobs was a fan of mag+ in #4):</strong></p>
					<p><strong>1. Familiarity and rich interactivity.&nbsp;</strong>mag+ Designd is an InDesign-based tool that has a similar workflow to DPS. Many professional designers think it’s even more intuitive, efficient and easier to use.</p>
					<p><strong>2. Keep existing users.</strong>&nbsp;When you migrate from a DPS app to a mag+ Designd app, your users won’t notice a thing. Well, maybe just a bit of interface restyling. It is simply a matter of submitting the mag+ Designd-based app as an update of the DPS app and converting back-issues if desired. In-app purchases and subscriptions can be moved over transparently, so you don’t risk losing even a single user.</p>
					<p><strong>3. Keep existing features.&nbsp;</strong>Our celebrated digital publishing software covers every part of the publishing process. We also support the majority of DPS&nbsp;overlay features, so the Slideshow, Pan &amp; Zoom, Scrollable Frames, Video, and Web Content &nbsp;features will all work as originally expected. You can even add some new features such as overlay navigation or disable swipe to create a touch-based only app.</p>
					<p><strong>4. We love the small names but big names also trust us.</strong>&nbsp;The very first iPad magazine Steve Jobs&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLgBMgf7vP8" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DrLgBMgf7vP8&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1518071508633000&amp;usg=AFQjCNElLosZPL4RJAiNtAjna10hib0YYA">showed off&nbsp;</a>was created with mag+. Today we continue to serve many international organizations such as Volvo, the United Nations, Siemens, Maserati, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.magplus.com/blog/from-indesign-to-ipad-new-york-magazine-gives-readers-custom-experiences/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.magplus.com/blog/from-indesign-to-ipad-new-york-magazine-gives-readers-custom-experiences/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1518071508633000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEiPDKRe7XTsR81JwCcYx6l8BcFTw">New York Magazine&nbsp;</a>who used our tool to create an app that combines weekly magazine content with daily website content in an innovative way.</p>

					<p><strong>8. No download fees.&nbsp;</strong>Most publishing solutions earn the lion’s share of their income from download fees. These fees can vary wildly and are unpredictable. mag+ includes 1TB for free or you can choose to use your own Amazon S3 account.</p>
